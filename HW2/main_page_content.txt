STOmics Stereo-seq
Independently developed by STOmics, Stereo-seq technology is the one and only spatial-omics technology in the world that could achieve both centimeter level panoramic field of view and subcellular resolution. Ever since its release in the early 2021, it has drawn extensive attention around the globe and was praised as 'the thunderclap in the academia', bringing life science research into a new era of time and space while ushering in the third revolution in the field of life sciences.
