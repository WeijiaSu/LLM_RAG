Solution Overview
Stereo-seq OMNI, a revolutionary sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics solution to study your FFPE samples.
Stereo-seq OMNI provides true spatial single-cell total RNA information with accuracy and precision with the innovative 'Random Probe' design. Covering a continuous tissue area of 10mm by 10mm, Stereo-seq OMNI delivers best-in-class data and bioinformatics workflow for analyzing spatial total RNA information.
Product Highlight
True single-cell level gene expression profiling combined with histology study
Species agnostic, enabling the study of host-microorganism interactions with spatial context
Random probe design for efficient total RNA capturing
Compatible with low-quality samples (DV200 > 30%)
